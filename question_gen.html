							<p>This project targets edtech domain and was build to help school teachers in framing test questions. The idea is to build an end to end pipelines that takes any text as input and generate different types of question from it. Currently our pipeline can generate MCQ's, True/False and Fill in the blank type questions. We are working towards fine tuning our pipeline to be also able to generate general text to text questions. </p>
							<center><h3>MCQ Generation</h3></center>
							<p>The complete pipeline for MCQ type question generation is shown below</p>
							<center><img src="images/MCQ_pipline.png" style="border:2px solid black;"></center>
							<ul>
								<li>The input text might be very big and not every sentence in the text might be important enough to build a question from. Therefore we first perform abstractive text summarization to not only reduce the text size but also to extract all the important information from the text.</li>
								<li>Most of the MCQ's are framed by asking the question around the keywords within the sentences. So we perform keyword extraction using spacy. This keyword will act as the correct option in the MCQ.</li>
								<li>Perform WSD using BERT-WSD to get the correct context of the keyword in the given sentence.</li>
								<li>Find the co-hypernyms of the keyword from WordNet using word sense generated by BERT-WSD. These words will act as wrong choices(Distractors) in the MCQ.</li>
								<li>Fine tune T5 transformer using SQuAD dataset to generate questions using keyword and text.</li>
								<li>Putting genetated question along with correct choice and distractors to create a complete MCQ.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Image below shows a test run of our pipeline on a given sentence.</p>

							<center><h3>Fill in the blanks Generation</h3></center>
							<p>Fill in the blanks can be generated using the same pipeline as MCQ generation. Once the keywords are identified, we simply replace the keyword with a blank. The final sentence than become Fill in the blank type question. </p>
							<center><h3>T/F Generation</h3></center>
							<p>For True/False type questions, we already have the true statements from the text. The main challenge is to look for ways to generate false statements. Simplest way to generate false statement is to replace the keyword in the sentnce by its WordNet co-hypernyms. Eventhough this approach generates good false statements but there is a better way to generate false statements whose truthfulness is harder to predict.</p>
							<p>The method is that instead of replacing keyword we replace the whole Verb phrase or Noun phrase in the sentence. We use constituency parsing to find verb or noun phrase present at the end of the text. We remove this phrase from the text.</p>
							<p>Then we use text generation models like GPT3 to complete the half sentence. These new generated sentences are most likely to be different from original sentence. Still for the sake of completeness we generate multiple sentences and pick the best possible one based on its dis-similarity from the original text. </p>
